                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                    <p>At the story's outset, it is revealed that Joe (born April 8) was orphaned at a young age. From flashbacks, it is revealed that Joe's biological mother, Sandy was abused by his biological father and that he was subjected to neglect and abuse by his father. Seeking to protect his mother, Joe shoots and kills his biological father. Sometime after, she tells him she is currently not fit to care for him and a Child Protection Services worker takes him and sends him to New York State's Irving Group Home For Boys.</p>
                    <p>After a few years in the foster care system, it's implied that Mr. Mooney adopted Joe, took care of him and gave him a job at the bookstore. Though, it is later highlighted that Mooney subjected Joe to a similar abusive treatment, locking him in a plexiglass cage vault, below his bookstore, against his will.</p>

                <h3>Season 1</h3>
                    <p>Joe, now the bookstore's manager, tries to win over MFA student Guinevere Beck by manipulating everything and everyone around her. He justifies his actions by stating that in order to pursue Beck, he wants to make sure that she is worth it and won't break his heart. He continuously implies that a similar instance occurred in the past with his ex-girlfriend, Candace Stone, who is presumed to be dead.</p>
                    <p>Joe is also good friends with his kid next-door neighbor, Paco, who has an abusive home life and is always trying to escape by reading books. After Paco attempts to kill Ron by giving him an overdose of pills, Ron passes out outside Joe's apartment and savagely beats Joe upon waking. Paco's mom, Claudia breaks up with Ron, with Joe's encouragement, but soon relapses back into drug addiction.</p>
                    <p>Joe and Beck eventually start dating and he is introduced to her wealthy Ivy League friends. Her best friend, Peach Salinger, is suspicious of his intentions and ridicules him for working in retail. Joe sees Peach as another obstacle in his relationship with Beck, so follows her in Central Park and hits her with a rock at the back of her head. He later kills her after she invites Beck to a retreat at the Salinger estate in Greenwich, framing her death as a suicide.</p>
